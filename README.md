# Helping Hubs

Helping Hubs aims to create a community for non-profit organizations, with the goal of assisting those lacking financial resources. This project will enable local organizations to showcase their mission and vision to the community.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
